Lyrics
I caught a cold because I kept turning the air conditioning on. 
I did not watch the video completely. 
I have a sore throat after discussing passionately about the topic. 
A smartphone does not function when the touch ID is not put correctly. 
You have to put in the password every time. 
I was exhausted after having club practice after school. 
I'd like to have some good ramen tonight.
"I overslept, so I missed the first period."
Would you come and join our club festival?
"You might be nervous at first, but I hope you will get accustomed to it sooner or later."
"The teacher's lessons are always dull, so I am sleepy during class. "
I have so much homework to write reports to do that I would not complete them.
I made many friends when I attended the welcome party. 
Which classes should I take to get the credit more accessible? 
"The first half of the class video was easy to understand, but the second half was not. "
I could not buy the textbook for my class because they were sold out in the campus bookstore. 
I didn't have time to study because I was busy with my part-time job. 
"If you don't get credit for this class, you will not be graduated. "
"I'm going to participate in the company's internship during the summer vacation, "
I'm so tired that I don't feel like studying.
I could have done better in the final examination of the subject. 
Can you introduce your friend to me? 
Can you get me something cold from the vending machine?
"I fell asleep in English class, and the teacher woke me up."
I can't finish studying because there are so many subjects to look at for the final exam.
"I looked at my smartphone during the class, but the teacher did not recognize it."
"If you have no idea to solve this math problem, you'd better go to the tutors to ask a question "
He is too busy with club activities to study.
Have you finished making the presentation slides for the class?
Could you check my presentation slides? I want to get your advice. 
"As it rains heavily, I'll ask my mother to pick me up at the university entrance. "
I always feel so sleepy during the lesson in that teacher's class. 
We're looking forward to attending the summer seminar with our classmates. 
Today's classes were enjoyable because we participated in an interesting experiment. 
Could you tell me how to make the presentation slides?
Come to join us for the welcome party after the class. 
Can you go to the classroom first and give me a seat?
Here are the handouts distributed in the last class. 
I am tired of playing games on my smartphone.
I finally got the credit for the class after doing the assignments.
Some of my friends commute to school from far distance.
You will gain high abilities if you attend the online class regularly.
"Today in class, the teacher told an interesting story and I had a lot of fun."
I'm so tired from studying for the test.
"My university is far from the station, and we must go by bus."
The buses to our university do not run fluently and are always crowded. 
It's really tough to go to the university by bus. 
I wish there were more buses for the university. 
How long does it take from the station to the university by bus? 
It's crazy to walk from the station to the university.
Some students go to university by bicycle. 
"If I came by bicycle, I'm sure I would be tired before class and fall asleep."
He always boasts that he rides his bike to school.  
I really envy you going to school by bike.
I will save money to buy a motorcycle.
I'm looking for a good part-time job for students.
Is there any good part-time job that wouldn't interfere with your studies at university? 
The professor in my laboratory introduced me to a good job.
I plan to give a presentation on this research in the upcoming workshop. 
My professor told me that this research theme is difficult.
I need to find more materials to continue this research.
I spend a long time in the lab when I do experiments.
There are many things to learn before conduction experiments.
I've learned that there are merits of utilizing deep learning systems.
Deep learning systems can be used in various ways. 
Now I understand the concept of algorism.
"In the future, I want to work for a manufacturing company."
Have you ever attended internship programs for companies?
A career adviser advised me to attend the job fair.
The representatives of local companies will attend the job fair.
You must make a reservation to attend the job fair.
"Now that I'm a junior, I must consider getting a job. "
"After graduating, I want to engage in game-producing companies. "
Have you ever heard about esports?
Professional game players are making a living through competitive gaming.
"If I became a professional gamer, I could enjoy my life."
Reservation is required to attend the popular event. 
"As I'm worried about finding a job, I will talk to my teacher. "
I recommend going to the tutoring center if you need help studying. 
I found out how to solve the problem when I asked my teacher.
What do you think is the best way to make friends?
I think he will be my lifelong friend. 
I will never forget these fond memories spent on my campus.
My professor always told me not to give up even some difficulties happen.
I'm happy to make friends with students from different departments. 
There are a few international students at this university. 
"In seminars, everyone should participate actively in discussions. "
It is a lot of fun to attend other students' research presentations. 
"If you are asked a question in your presentation, you should answer honestly."
His approach to the research is very informative.
"Although creating game characters was time-consuming, I found it to be fun. "
"The professor suggests that, by utilizing algorithms, this process could be easier. "
I would like to have more advice on creating the presentation slides. 
Could you tell me what this error message suggests?
This app always gives us error messages. 
I can't imagine life without a smartphone.
It took a lot of work to prepare presentation assignments in class.
"When I showed him my research outline, he gave me much advice."
My classmate's presentation on that theme inspired me.
I have the ambition to become a scientist who works globally.
